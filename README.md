# LEAFY 2.0
I am rewriting my [Leafy app](https://github.com/hstonehouse/leafy) using Ruby on Rails as a way to practice RoR as well as finish up the features that I didn't get to the first time around, namely partial searching.

### How to install React and all the necessary dependencies
```
npx create-react-app leafy-on-rails
npm install
npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@latest
```

### TODOS:
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
