# LEAFY 2.0
I am rewriting my [Leafy app](https://github.com/hstonehouse/leafy) using Ruby on Rails as a way to practice RoR as well as finish up the features that I didn't get to the first time around, namely partial searching.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
